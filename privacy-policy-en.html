    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Baby Tracker stores your records locally on your device.</li>
      <li>The app does not require an account and does not ask for your name, email, or phone number.</li>
      <li>Third-party ads may be shown. Ad providers may collect limited device information (such as advertising
        identifiers) to serve and measure ads.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Baby Tracker does not collect personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
    Your entries (e.g., baby tracking records) are stored locally on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The app may display advertisements provided by third-party ad networks.
    These providers may automatically collect limited device information (for example, advertising identifiers, IP
    address, and basic device/usage signals)
    to serve relevant ads, prevent fraud, and measure ad performance.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Data</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. We do not share your in-app records with third parties because they are stored
    locally on your device.
    However, advertising providers may process limited device information as described above when ads are displayed.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Baby Tracker is designed for parents and caregivers. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from
    children.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since data is stored locally on your device, your device security (passcode/biometrics) is an important layer of
    protection.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us via the email address provided on the app store
    listing.
