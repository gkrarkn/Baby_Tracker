  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: December 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Baby Tracker does not collect personal data such as name, email address, phone number,
    precise location, or any directly identifiable information.
    Baby tracking records (such as sleep durations, time ranges, and usage statistics)
    are stored locally on the user’s device by default.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Anonymous and Aggregated Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    To improve user experience and enhance the product, the app may use
    <strong>anonymized and aggregated</strong> statistical data that cannot be linked
    to an individual user or child.
  </p>
  <p>
    This data does not identify users and does not reveal individual behavior.
    Anonymous data may be used for statistical analysis, identifying general trends,
    and product development purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The app may display advertisements provided by third-party ad networks.
    These providers may process limited device information (such as advertising identifiers,
    IP address, and basic device signals) to deliver ads, prevent fraud, and measure performance.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Baby Tracker does not sell personal data and does not share individual user records
    with third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only <strong>anonymous and aggregated</strong> statistical data may be shared with
    business partners for purposes such as product improvement, market analysis,
    and research. Such data never contains information that can identify a specific user or child.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Baby Tracker is designed for parents and caregivers.
    The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children
    and does not process identifying data related to children.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Most data is stored locally on the user’s device.
    Device-level security measures (such as passcodes, biometric protection,
    and operating system security features) play an important role in protecting this data.
  </p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Users can disable anonymous data contribution through the app settings.
    Users may also delete all in-app records at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
